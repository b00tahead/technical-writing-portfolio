# Technical Writing Portfolio
## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm just starting my journey into technical writing, bringing along my experience in frontend development and UX design. While I'm new to technical writing itself, I've spent years working with documentation as a developer and know the difference between docs that help and docs that make you want to throw your computer out the window.

## Why technical writing?
My background in web development taught me that great documentation is crucial. After years of using (and sometimes struggling with) various docs, I'm excited to help create the kind of clear, helpful guides I always wished I had when learning new tools.

## What I bring to the table
- Frontend development experience: I understand the technical concepts I'm writing about
- UX design background: I know how to organize information so it makes sense
- Fresh perspective: I'm bring a user's eye to documentation
- Eagerness to learn: I'm actively building my technical writing skills

## My approach to documentation
I am to create guides that:
- Start with the basics and build up gradually
- Include the context I always wished other docs had included
- Use real examples that actually help
- Skip the jargon (or explain it when it's necessary)

## Tools & technologies I know well
- Frontend: React, TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML, Tailwind, CSS
- Design: Figma, design systems, design thinking, human-centered design

## Let's connect
I'm eager to learn and contribute to making technology more accessible through clear documentation. While I'm just starting out in technical writing, I'm committed to creating content that genuinely helps users succeed.
